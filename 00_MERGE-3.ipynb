    "Recommender System is an information filtering tool that seeks to predict which product a user will like, and based on that, recommends a few products to the users. For example, Amazon can recommend new shopping items to buy, Netflix can recommend new movies to watch, and Google can recommend news that a user might be interested in. Recommendation engines help users see items they may not know are relevant to them. The two widely used approaches for building a recommender system are the content-based filtering (CBF) and collaborative filtering (CF).\n",

However, the drawback with explicit data is that it puts the responsibility of data collection on the user, who may not want to take time to enter ratings. On the other hand, **implicit** data is easy to collect in large quantities without any extra effort on the part of the user. Unfortunately, it is much more difficult to work with."

    "The main idea behind CBF is to recommend items similar to the items previously liked by the user. For example, if the user have rated some items in the past, then these items are used for *user-modeling* where the user’s interests are quantified. Traditionally, the item is represented by a feature vector xi, which can be boolean or real valued, and the user is represented by a weight vector of same dimension. Given a new item x, represented in the same feature vector space, the likeliness, e.g., rating of the item is predicted using the user model.\n",

    "• Predicting ratings using parametric models like regression or logistic regression for multiple ratings and binary ratings respectively based on the previous ratings.\n",

    "• Similarity based techniques using distance measures to find similar items to the items liked by the user based on item features.\n",
    "\n",
    "CB can be applied even when a strong user-base is not built, as it depends on the item’s meta data (features) therefore does not suffer from cold-start problem. However, this also makes it computationally intensive, as similarities between each user and all the items must be computed. Since the recommendations are based on the item similarity to the item that the user already knows about, it leaves no room for serendipity and causes over specialisation. CB also ignores popularity of an item and other users feedbacks.\n",

    "What is matrix factorization? Matrix factorization is simply a family of mathematical operations for matrices in linear algebra. To be specific, a **matrix factorization** is a factorization of a matrix into a product of matrices. In the case of collaborative filtering, matrix factorization algorithms work by **decomposing** the user-item interaction matrix into the product of two **lower dimensionality rectangular matrices**. One matrix can be seen as the user matrix where rows represent users and columns are latent factors. The other matrix is the item matrix where rows are latent factors and columns represent items.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does matrix factorization solve our problems?\n",
    "\n",
    "Model learns to factorize rating matrix into user and movie representations, which allows model to predict better personalized movie ratings for users\n",
    "\n",
    "With matrix factorization, less-known movies can have rich latent representations as much as popular movies have, which improves recommender’s ability to recommend less-known movies\n",
    "\n",
    "In the sparse user-item interaction matrix, the predicted rating user `u` will give item `i` is computed as:\n",

    "\n",
    "Rating of item `i` given by user `u` can be expressed as a dot product of the user latent vector and the item latent vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice in above formula, the number of **latent factors** can be tuned via cross-validation. **Latent factors** are the features in the lower dimension latent space projected from user-item interaction matrix. The idea behind matrix factorization is to use latent factors to represent user preferences or movie topics in a much lower dimension space. Matrix factorization is one of very effective **dimension reduction** techniques in machine learning.\n",

    "\n",
    "Very much like the concept of **components** in **PCA**, the number of latent factors determines the amount of abstract information that we want to store in a lower dimension space. A matrix factorization with one latent factor is equivalent to a *most popular or top popular* recommender (e.g. recommends the items with the most interactions without any personalization). Increasing the number of latent factors will improve personalization, until the number of factors becomes too high, at which point the model starts to overfit. A common strategy to avoid overfitting is to add **regularization terms** to the objective function.\n",

The newly-solved factor matrix is then held constant while solving for the other factor matrix.\n",
