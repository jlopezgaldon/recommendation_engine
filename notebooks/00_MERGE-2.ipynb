    "Recommender System is an information filtering tool that seeks to predict which product a user will like, and based on that, recommends a few products to the users. For example, Amazon can recommend new shopping items to buy, Netflix can recommend new movies to watch, and Google can recommend news that a user might be interested in. The two widely used approaches for building a recommender system are the content-based filtering (CBF) and collaborative filtering (CF).\n",

However, the drawback with explicit data is that it puts the responsibility of data collection on the user, who may not want to take time to enter ratings. On the other hand, **implicit** data is easy to collect in large quantities without any extra effort on the part of the user. Unfortunately, it is much more difficult to work with."

    "### Content-based Filtering (CBF)\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea behind CBF is to recommend items similar to the items previously liked by the user. For example, if the user have rated some items in the past, then these items are used for *user-modeling* where the user’s interests are quantified. Traditionally, the item is represented by a feature vector xi, which can be boolean or real valued, and the user is represented by a weight vector of same dimension. Given a new item x, represented in the same feature vector space, the likeliness, e.g., rating of the item is predicted using the user model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be achieved in two different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Predicting ratings using parametric models like regression or logistic regression for multiple ratings and binary ratings respectively based on the previous ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Similarity based techniques using distance measures to find similar items to the items liked by the user based on item features.\n",
    "\n",
    "CB can be applied even when a strong user-base is not built, as it depends on the item’s meta data (features) therefore does not suffer from cold-start problem. However, this also makes it computationally intensive, as similarities between each user and all the items must be computed. Since the recommendations are based on the item similarity to the item that the user already knows about, it leaves no room for serendipity and causes over specialisation. CB also ignores popularity of an item and other users feedbacks.\n",

    "*item-item* based CF became popular later, where to recommend an item to a user, the similarity between items liked by the user and other items are calculated.
